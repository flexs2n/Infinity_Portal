# Social Signal Intelligence Platform for Stocks

We have built a trust-first web application designed for wealth management and financial advisory firms to analyze stock movements through social media topic analysis. It is built with transparency and auditability at its core.

## Overview

Our platform helps wealth managers and financial advisors understand portfolio movements by analyzing **static social media datasets**. Unlike real-time sentiment tools, this application prioritizes evidence-based narratives and  source attribution which is essential for client communications and regulatory reviews.

### Key Principles

- **Evidence-First**: Every narrative links directly to source posts with post IDs
- **Balanced Analysis**: Counter-narratives are surfaced alongside supporting evidence
- **Audit Trail**: Full logging of user edits and exports
- **Trading Signals**: This tool provides context and possible buy/sell recommendations
- **Compliance-Ready**: Export client-safe memos with complete source attribution

## Use Cases

- Explain unusual price movements to clients with documented social context
- Prepare compliance documentation for investment decisions
- Research historical market events and their social media footprint
- Train junior advisors on narrative construction and source evaluation

## Tech Stack

### Frontend (`/web`)
- **Next.js 14** (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** components
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **localStorage** for user edits, auditting logs and exporting history

### Backend (`/api`)
- **Python 3.11** with **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn**
- **Pydantic** for type-safe request/response models
- **CORS enabled** for local development
- **No external dependencies** (static dataset only)

## Repository Structure
```
/
├── web/                 # Next.js frontend application
├── api/                 # FastAPI backend server
├── data/
│   └── sample.json      # Static mock dataset
└── README.md
```

## Data Model

The static dataset (`/data/sample.json`) contains:

- **instruments**: Stock ticker symbols and company names
- **price_series**: Historical price and volume data
- **events**: Significant price movements with metadata (move %, volatility z-score)
- **topics**: Social media topic clusters with sentiment, keywords, and post references
- **posts**: Individual social media posts with engagement metrics

### Sample Event Structure
```json
{
  "id": "evt_001",
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "window_start": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
  "window_end": "2024-01-17T23:59:59Z",
  "move_pct": 8.5,
  "vol_z": 2.3,
  "headline": "Apple shares surge on AI partnership rumors"
}
```

### Topic Analysis
Each topic includes:
- `evidence_post_ids[]`: Posts supporting the narrative
- `counter_post_ids[]`: Posts challenging or contradicting the narrative
- `sentiment_score`: Normalized sentiment (-1 to 1)
- `share_of_posts`: Topic prevalence in the conversation

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/instruments` | List all available tickers |
| `GET` | `/ticker/{ticker}/series` | Price/volume time series |
| `GET` | `/ticker/{ticker}/events` | Significant price events |
| `GET` | `/ticker/{ticker}/event/{id}` | Full event analysis with topics and posts |
| `POST` | `/export` | Generate client-safe memo (Markdown) |

### Export Request Format
```json
{
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "event_id": "evt_001",
  "selected_topic_ids": ["topic_1", "topic_3"],
  "edited_summary": "Custom narrative...",
  "client_safe": true
}
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Python 3.11+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-name>
```

2. **Backend Setup**
```bash
   cd api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

3. **Frontend Setup**
```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   npm run dev
```

4. **Access the app**
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Features

### Evidence Transparency
- Click any narrative to view supporting posts with direct links
- See counter-arguments and contradictory evidence next to each other
- Filter topics by sentiment, prevalence or any other custom criteria

### Audit & Compliance
- Every user edit is logged with timestamp
- Export history tracked in localStorage
- Generate memos that strip internal annotations
- Markdown exports include full source attribution

### User Workflow
1. Select a ticker and date range
2. Review detected price events (volatility, magnitude, volume)
3. Explore topic clusters with evidence/counter-evidence
4. Edit and refine narrative for client presentation
5. Export compliance-ready memo with full audit trail

## Design Philosophy

This tool is **intentionally limited**:
- No live API calls or web scraping
- No algorithmic trading signals
- No predictive models or recommendations
But:
- Static datasets for reproducibility
- Human-in-the-loop narrative construction
- Full transparency on data sources

## Limitations & Disclaimers

- **Not Financial Advice**: This tool provides context, not investment recommendations.
- **Static Data Only**: No real-time feeds; datasets must be manually updated
- **Research Purposes**: Designed for internal analysis and client communication
- **No Guarantees**: Social sentiment does not predict future performance
